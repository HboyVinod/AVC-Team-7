Tasks:
 - Turning function to turn left/right 90 degrees, and to do a 180 (maybe 3 sepparate functions).
 - Function to take a value (-10 to 10) and turn that much, WITHOUT STOPPING (so it might just slow down one wheel and speed up the other).
 - Fucntion to set the speed (to some default forwards value) and save the value (possibly one for the left wheel and one for the right)
   in a global variable.
